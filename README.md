# sample github actions config

This is the pattern I always end up with for CI via github actions, so I extracted it into a separate repo so I can copy-paste it into new projects for myself easier later. You can use, too, if you want.

## usage

- copy the `.github` and `scripts` folders into your repo
- modify `scripts/ci.sh`
  - you can move it somewhere else if you prefer; you just have to update ci.yml to match
- that's it
